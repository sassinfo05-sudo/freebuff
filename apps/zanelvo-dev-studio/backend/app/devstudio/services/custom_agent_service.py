"""CustomAgentService — founder-defined agent roles (CustomAgentRoleConfig): both fully custom
roles created from Settings, and the seven specialist sub-agents this product ships with by
default (Vision, Frontend/Backend/Fullstack Testing, Troubleshoot, Deployment — "Integration" was
already a built-in implementer role, see models.BUILTIN_AGENT_ROLES, so it isn't re-seeded here).

All of them are stored as data, not code, so every role — shipped or founder-added — is equally
inspectable/editable from Settings; `built_in=True` only means "can't be deleted", not "can't be
edited". They're all `category="implementer"`, meaning the Planner can assign a plan item directly
to any of them (see agents/roles.py::_planner_system) — a Frontend Testing Agent plan item writing
a new test file, or a Troubleshoot Agent one proposing a genuinely different fix, are both natural
fits for the same file_operations contract every other implementer role already uses.
