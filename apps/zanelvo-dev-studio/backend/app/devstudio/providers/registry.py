"""ModelRegistry — the one place that knows which LLMProvider classes exist and how to build them.

Deliberately provider-independent: adding a new vendor means adding one entry to `_PROVIDER_CLASSES`
and one `ModelInfo` list; nothing in agents/ or services/ changes.

Preset design (ECONOMICAL/BALANCED/MAX_QUALITY): coding-heavy roles (analyst, planner, frontend,
backend, integration, supervisor) stay on Anthropic across all three tiers — Claude has the most
consistently-reported edge on agentic coding/tool-use benchmarks, so using anything else there
would be diversity for its own sake, not a real improvement. Two roles genuinely diverge:

- Design uses Gemini: it works with screenshots, reference images, and design language — Gemini's
  multimodal + very large context window (1M tokens) is a real, task-specific advantage there, not
  a general capability claim over Anthropic.
- Reviewer uses OpenAI as primary (Anthropic as fallback): an independent second opinion from a
  different lab than the implementer reduces correlated blind spots — the same reason a human
  reviewer shouldn't be the PR's own author. This is an architectural choice, not a claim that
  OpenAI reviews code better than Claude does.

Within Anthropic, MAX_QUALITY further splits Fable 5.1 vs Opus 5 by role rather than picking one
model for everything:

- Supervisor, Repository Analyst, Planner, and Frontend use Fable 5.1 — it's Anthropic's newest
  flagship, built for long-running agentic problem-solving and self-recovery, and beats Opus 5 on
  most benchmarks while using far fewer output tokens. Its weak spot is lower single-shot (pass@1)
  accuracy than Opus, which matters less for orchestration/analysis/planning/UI work, where a
  wrong first attempt gets caught and retried rather than shipped.
- Backend and Integration stay on Opus 5. Fable carries safety guardrails around cybersecurity/
  biology content that can trigger on legitimate security-adjacent code (auth flows, crypto,
  sandboxing, permission checks) — exactly what these two roles write routinely — and silently
  falls back to a weaker model (Opus 4.8) when it does. Opus 5 has no such block risk and the
  highest pass@1 of the lineup, which is worth more than Fable's efficiency gains for code that
  guards tenant boundaries and secrets.
- Design and Reviewer are unaffected by this split — they were already on Gemini/OpenAI.

Model names/prices were checked against each vendor's own current pricing docs (Sept 2026) rather
than assumed — see the commit that added the OpenAI/Gemini providers.

Credential paths (Settings > Secrets, or the equivalent env vars): native per-vendor API keys
(anthropic/openai/gemini — one key each), Amazon Bedrock (an AWS access key/secret pair + region,
or the default AWS credential chain if no key pair is stored — see bedrock_provider.py), Google's
Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform (a GCP project/location + optional service account JSON, or
Application Default Credentials if none is stored — see gemini_enterprise_provider.py), and the
Emergent Universal Key (intentional stub, see emergent_provider.py). None of the three presets
route through Bedrock, Gemini Enterprise, or Emergent by default; all three are available as an
explicit per-role override (Settings > Agents > pick a role > choose provider) for deployments
that need them, without changing what ships to everyone else.
