"""Role agents: Repository Analyst, Planner, Design/Frontend/Backend/Integration ("implementer"),
QA, Reviewer/Security, Git. Supervisor lives in orchestrator.py since it's mostly deterministic
control flow rather than a single prompt-response step.

Each LLM-backed function is a thin composition of ContextBuilder -> prompt -> runner.call_structured
-> validated dict. Implementers return a list of file operations; nothing here touches the
filesystem directly — the orchestrator applies operations through FileService so stale-patch
protection and path-safety are enforced in exactly one place.
